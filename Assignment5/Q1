Final: Final is a keyword which is used to put restrictions on class, variable and method. Adding final to class means the class cannot 
       be extended by other class. Method with class cannot be overridden in child class. And making variable final means it cannot be 
       changed after it is initialized.
Finally: Finally is a block to use with try/catch statement. In the block, it should include code to do operation after try/catch whether the 
         exception is thrown or not. It can also be put after try block without catch block.
