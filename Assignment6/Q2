1. LinkedList can iterates in reverse direction using descendingIterator(), but ArrayList doesn't have which means we need to write code 
iterate over ArrayList in reverse direction.
2. ArrayList get() function runs much faster than LinkedList get() since ArrayList uses index based system for elements but LinkedList
doesn't provide index based access, it iterates either from beginning or end to find the nodes.
